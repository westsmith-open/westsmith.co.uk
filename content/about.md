Our team brings deep expertise in:

* **Backend development** using Python, Go, and modern API frameworks like FastAPI, Flask and Django
* **Cloud infrastructure** across AWS and GCP, including serverless architecture, container orchestration and infrastructure as code
* **DevOps and SRE practices** to ensure stable and automated deployments
* **Full-stack delivery**, from prototypes to production, with a strong grasp of front-end templating, CI/CD and testing pipelines

We’ve contributed to mission-critical systems for the Office for National Statistics, University of Cambridge, Babylon Health, Vodafone, IBM, and others. Whether supporting large-scale platforms or working with early-stage teams, we bring the same principles: clear communication, pragmatic design and a focus on delivering value early.

We're hands-on engineers who aren’t afraid to dive into legacy code, modernise cloud infrastructure, or build from the ground up. We also keep a sharp eye on emerging technologies, including LLMs and AI agents.
