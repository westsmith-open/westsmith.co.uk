# Breathing New Life Into Old Code: Modernising Legacy Systems

Legacy systems don’t have to be a liability. With the right approach, you can make them work well today — and lay the groundwork for something better tomorrow.

We cover:
- Common signs your software is holding you back
- Options for updating, refactoring or wrapping old code
- How to modernise safely without stopping business
- Lessons from real-world modernisation projects

Your current system might be a foundation — not a dead end.
