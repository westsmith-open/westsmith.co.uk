## üõ§Ô∏è Evolution of the Site

This site has gone through several iterations:

- **Early days:** Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) ‚Äî fast, but limited in flexibility.
- **Then:** Rebuilt using [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com) for its ease of drag-and-drop editing. It worked but didn‚Äôt feel like "code".
- **Now:** Fully rebuilt from scratch using Python and [Frozen Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/), giving full control over content, structure, and generation.  
  This version is statically generated, committed to GitHub, and hosted via GitHub Pages.

This project is inspired in part by [danielball.com](https://danielball.com), a sister site that follows a similar philosophy ‚Äî simplicity, control, and developer-friendliness. That site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and also hosted on GitHub Pages.
